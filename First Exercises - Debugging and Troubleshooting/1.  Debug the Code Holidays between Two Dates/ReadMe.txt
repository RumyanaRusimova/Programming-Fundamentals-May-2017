6.	Debug the Code: Holidays between Two Dates
You are assigned to find and fix the bugs in an existing piece of code, using the Visual Studio debugger. You should trace the program execution to find the lines of code that produce incorrect or unexpected results.
You are given a program (existing source code) that aims to count the non-working days between two dates given in format day.month.year (e.g. between 1.05.2015 and 15.05.2015 there are 5 non-working days – Saturday and Sunday).

You can find the broken code in the judge system: https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/204/Git-GitHub-Debugging-Searching-Lab. It looks as follows:

Hints
There are 4 mistakes in the code. You’ve got to use the debugger to find them and fix them. After you do that, submit your fixed code in the judge contest: https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/Practice/Index/204#0.
